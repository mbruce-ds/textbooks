My personal solutions for the exercises for some textbooks I'm working through.

No guarantee about the correctness or completeness of any of these solutions. I'm kind of an idiot.

Currently working on:
- The Art of Computer Programming - Donald Knuth

(yes this will take like 3 years to get through all of the volumes)
