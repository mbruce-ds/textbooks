My personal solutions for the exercises for some textbooks I'm working through.

No guarantee about the correctness or completeness of any of these solutions, I'm working through this as any readers are presumably doing as well :)

Currently working on:
- Introduction to Algorithms - CLRS
- The Art of Computer Programming - Donald Knuth

Was gonna do TAoCP first since I kind of have a loose understanding of like half of CLRS just from random classes I've taken + my undergrad algorithms class but I may as well go through it properly and try coding everything cause why not.
